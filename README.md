# Coffee_Ratings
Introduction - All about Coffee Ratings
We explored the data with visualizations to determine the best cup of coffee. We modeled the data using random forest and linear regression models.

# Technologies
Plotly, Plotly Express, Jupyter notebook, Pandas, Python, Javascript, D3, Google Cloud, MongoDB, Chart.js, HTML, CSS, Flask API, R 

# About the Data
We used data from the Coffee Quality Institute, this provided us data for flavor, balance, aftertaste, body, aroma, acidity, moisture, uniformity, sweetness, defects, and cleanliness of cup. There are two different types of coffee Robusta and Arabica, based off the data 98% preferred Arabica versus 2% Robusta.

# Methods
The methods that were used were Random Forest regressor and important features, Full linear model, and Reduced linear model

# Post-mortem
Planned to use a random forest classifier but since the variables were all numerical, we had to use a random forest regressor
Initially wanted to do k-means or k nearest neighbors but the data wasnâ€™t structured in a way that allowed for that.
